# Chicago & NYC Cohort Sightseeing App
## Explore the bustling metropolis's of Chicago & New York City!
## Due to the COVID restrictions, the Software Engineering Cohorts of 2/1/21 for Flatiron School Chicago & New York were merged. We thought best to give our teammates from other cities a chance to take a 'virtual tour' of either respective cohort location.
